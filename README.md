CSS Event Queue
===============

CSS Event Queue - Synchronous / Asynchronous Javascript event queue for CSS Classes


## How it works

Allows you to both ADD and REMOVE CSS classes from DOM elements, synchronously and asynchronously.  This plugin allows us to bind classes to DOM elements (HTML Tags) based on 4 types of events. These events include:
  
  • On Click - An element is clicked and the task scheduler initiates its queue.
  
  • On Hover - An element is hovered over and the task scheduler initiates its queue.
  
  • On Dom Ready - When the page has fully loaded the task scheduler initiates its queue.
  
  • On Active Class - When the class name "active" is detected, the task scheduler initiates its queue.
